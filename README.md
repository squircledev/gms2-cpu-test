 GMS2 2.2 vs 2.3 CPU usage test
 
# Usage
simply run and check your CPU/GPU usage and note the differences between 2.2 and 2.3 versions of the same project (besides project format differences)

Please note that 23.1.1.268 is basically the same as latest 2.3.2 runtime, just with the beta names because I don't feel like figuring out how to have two stable versions of GMS installed at the same time.
