# gms2-cpu-test
 GMS2 2.2 vs 2.3 CPU usage test
 
# Numbers
cputest1 = 2.2, sleep margin 10ms
cputest2 = 2.2, sleep margin 1ms
cputest3 = 2.3, sleep margin 10ms
cputest4 = 2.3, sleep margin 1ms
 
# Usage
simply run and check your CPU/GPU usage and note the differences between 2.2 and 2.3 versions of the same project (besides project format differences)

Please note that 23.1.1.268 is basically the same as latest 2.3.2 runtime, just with the beta names because I don't feel like figuring out how to have two stable versions of GMS installed at the same time.
